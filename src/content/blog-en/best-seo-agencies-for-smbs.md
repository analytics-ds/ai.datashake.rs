## Why SMBs need a specific SEO approach

### SMB-specific constraints

**SMBs** represent 99% of businesses and face unique SEO challenges:

- **Limited budget**: an SMB cannot invest €10,000/month in SEO. The strategy must be optimized to maximize ROI with constrained resources
- **Need for quick results**: unlike large companies, SMBs need to see business impact within months to justify the investment
- **Reduced internal resources**: no dedicated marketing department, often a single person managing all digital activities
- **Competition with larger players**: SMBs must compete in SEO with companies that have 10 to 100 times their marketing budget
- **Importance of local**: for most SMBs, local visibility is a priority (Google Business Profile, "near me" searches)

### GEO: a unique opportunity for SMBs

**[GEO](/en/blog/what-is-geo/)** (Generative Engine Optimization) represents an **exceptional opportunity** for SMBs. Unlike traditional SEO where large companies dominate through domain authority, generative AIs select their sources by evaluating content **relevance** and **expertise** — two criteria where a specialized SMB can outperform a generalist large corporation.

In 2026, AI-referred traffic surged by **527%**. An SMB with expert content, well-deployed [structured data](/en/blog/structured-data-schema-org-guide/), and solid [E-E-A-T](/en/blog/e-e-a-t-and-geo/) signals can be cited in AI Overviews ahead of much larger players. To learn more, see our guide on [how to optimize content for generative AI](/en/blog/optimize-content-for-generative-ai/).

### Local SEO: the #1 lever for SMBs

**Local SEO** is the primary organic growth lever for SMBs:

- **46%** of Google searches have local intent
- **78%** of local mobile searches lead to an in-store purchase within 24 hours
- Optimized Google Business Profile listings generate **7 times more interactions** than unoptimized listings
- Customer reviews influence **93%** of local purchase decisions

## Criteria for selecting an SEO agency for SMBs

### Essential skills

Choosing an **SEO agency for SMBs** should rely on adapted criteria:

- **SMB experience**: verifiable references in similar-sized businesses, understanding of budget constraints
- **Local SEO**: mastery of Google Business Profile, NAP citations, customer reviews, local pack
- **Pragmatism**: ability to prioritize high-impact, fast-ROI actions rather than lengthy strategies
- **Pricing transparency**: clear offers, without excessive commitment, with predictable budgets
- **Education**: ability to explain strategy and results in business language (leads, revenue, ROI) rather than SEO jargon
- **GEO and AI**: ability to position the SMB in generative AI responses

### Quality signals to verify

- **SMB portfolio**: documented case studies with comparable-sized businesses
- **Measurable results**: metrics in organic traffic, conversions, and revenue (not just rankings)
- **Contractual flexibility**: flexible contracts (monthly or quarterly, not imposed annual)
- **Dedicated contact**: a single consultant who knows your file
- **Expertise in [structured data](/en/blog/structured-data-schema-org-guide/)** — an accessible and decisive lever for SMB AI visibility
