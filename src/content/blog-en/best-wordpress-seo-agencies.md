## Why WordPress SEO Requires Specific Expertise

### WordPress: The Dominant but Demanding CMS

**WordPress** powers over **43% of websites globally** in 2026, making it by far the most widely used CMS. This popularity comes with a rich ecosystem — over 60,000 plugins and 10,000 themes — but also specific SEO challenges that other CMS platforms do not present.

### WordPress-Specific SEO Challenges

- **Taxonomy management**: categories, tags, author archives, and date archives generate low-SEO-value pages by default that dilute crawl budget. Poor management leads to duplicate content and indexed thin content
- **Performance**: plugin proliferation, poorly coded themes, and unoptimized SQL queries directly impact loading times — a critical ranking factor since Core Web Vitals
- **Security**: WordPress is the #1 target for web attacks. A compromised site suffers indexation penalties that can destroy months of SEO work
- **SEO plugins**: Yoast SEO, Rank Math, and SEOPress offer powerful features but their default configuration is rarely optimal. Expert configuration can make a significant difference
- **Structured data**: plugins generate basic Schema.org schemas. For advanced markup (FAQPage, HowTo, enriched Article with Expert author), intervention beyond plugins is needed
- **Permalink structure**: URL structure choice has a permanent SEO impact and any subsequent change requires a rigorous redirect plan

### The GEO Challenge for WordPress Sites

Beyond traditional SEO, WordPress sites now face **[GEO](/en/blog/what-is-geo/)** (Generative Engine Optimization). In 2026, AI-referred traffic surged by **527%**, and brands cited in Google's AI Overviews receive **35% more organic clicks**. WordPress's flexibility allows deploying advanced GEO optimizations, but knowing which ones and how to implement them requires expertise. For deeper insights, consult our guide on [how to optimize content for generative AI](/en/blog/optimize-content-for-generative-ai/).

## Selection Criteria for a WordPress SEO Agency

### Essential Skills

Choosing a **WordPress SEO agency** should be based on objective criteria:

- **WordPress technical expertise**: knowledge of the core, hooks/filters, APIs, theme and plugin behavior
- **Structured data**: advanced Schema.org deployment beyond plugins (custom JSON-LD, Person, Organization, FAQPage)
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals optimization, cache management (Redis, Varnish), CDN, SQL query optimization
- **Content strategy**: information architecture, internal linking, taxonomy management
- **SEO security**: attack prevention, indexation monitoring, recovery plans
- **GEO and AI**: optimization for generative search engines

### Quality Signals to Verify

- **Verifiable WordPress portfolio** with measured SEO results
- **Documented case studies** with organic traffic metrics
- **Certifications** and partnerships (Google Partner, WordPress contributions)
- **Transparent methodology** with regular reporting
- **[Structured data](/en/blog/structured-data-schema-org-guide/) expertise** — a decisive lever for AI visibility
