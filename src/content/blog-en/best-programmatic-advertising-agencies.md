- **AI and optimization**: artificial intelligence algorithms are transforming bid optimization, creative, and targeting

### Programmatic and GEO: strategic complementarity

Programmatic and **[GEO](/en/blog/what-is-geo/)** are complementary: programmatic generates visibility and qualified traffic, while GEO ensures presence in generative AI responses.
