## The Context: Why OpenAI Is Turning to Advertising

The announcement sent shockwaves through the digital marketing world: **ChatGPT is launching advertising**. After months of speculation, OpenAI officially confirmed the integration of ad formats within its conversational assistant, initially in the US market. This decision marks a strategic turning point for the company, which had long resisted this option.

### The Economic Reasons Behind This Decision

OpenAI's business model has so far relied primarily on subscriptions (ChatGPT Plus at $20/month, Team, Enterprise) and API revenue. However, the **infrastructure costs** associated with training and running language models are colossal. According to estimates published by The Information, OpenAI spends more than **$5 billion per year** on computing costs.

The introduction of advertising therefore responds to a financial imperative:

- **Diversify revenue streams** beyond subscriptions
- **Monetize the free user base** of over 200 million weekly users
- **Fund R&D** on next-generation models (GPT-5 and beyond)
- **Prepare for a potential IPO** with solid recurring revenues

### The Precedent of Conversational Search

This development is part of a broader trend. Microsoft already integrated ads into **Bing Chat** as early as 2023. Google is experimenting with sponsored formats in its **AI Overviews**. Perplexity AI has also announced an advertising program. It is therefore logical that OpenAI would follow this trajectory, especially since [AI search engines like Perplexity, ChatGPT, and Google SGE](/en/blog/perplexity-chatgpt-google-sge-comparison/) are all converging toward a hybrid model mixing organic responses and sponsored content.

## How Advertising Works in ChatGPT

**ChatGPT's** advertising model fundamentally differs from traditional search engine advertising. It is not about displaying sponsored links above results, but about integrating **contextual recommendations** at the very heart of conversational responses.

### The Principle of Conversational Advertising

Unlike traditional Google **search ads**, ads in ChatGPT are generated contextually. The system analyzes the user's query, the ongoing conversation, and suggests products or services **directly within the response flow**.

For example, if a user asks "what is the best accounting software for an SME?", the response could include a sponsored recommendation flagged as such, integrated among organic suggestions.

### The Advertising Infrastructure

OpenAI recruited **Shivakumar Venkataraman**, former Vice President of Google Ads, to lead this initiative. The advertising infrastructure relies on:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Contextual targeting** | Real-time analysis of the query and conversational context |
| **Native format** | Ads integrated into the response text, identified by a "Sponsored" label |
| **Performance measurement** | Click, engagement, and conversion metrics specific to the conversational format |
| **Advertiser API** | Self-service platform for advertisers (in development) |

> "The goal is to create an advertising experience that is useful to the user rather than intrusive. Advertising in a conversational context must provide value."
> — Shivakumar Venkataraman, VP Advertising at OpenAI

## The Ad Formats Envisioned by OpenAI

OpenAI is testing several formats to find the balance between **monetization** and **user experience**. The approach is progressive, with a phased rollout.

### Formats Currently Being Tested

Three types of ads are being experimented with in the United States:

- **Product recommendations**: sponsored suggestions in responses related to purchases or comparisons
- **Sponsored links**: links identified as sponsored within factual or technical responses
- **Visual inserts**: discreet banners displayed below certain responses, with an image and CTA

### The Difference from Google Ads

**OpenAI's** model differs from Google's on several fundamental points:

| Criterion | Google Ads | ChatGPT Ads |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Format** | Text links above results | Integrated within the conversational response |
| **Targeting** | Keywords + user data | Real-time conversational context |
| **Experience** | Clear separation between organic/paid | Blended into the response flow |
| **Measurement** | CTR, CPC, Quality Score | Conversational engagement, interaction rate |
| **Volume** | Billions of queries/day | 200+ million users/week |

### Exclusion of Paid Subscribers

A crucial point: OpenAI has confirmed that **ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Enterprise** users will not see ads. This "freemium with ads" model is reminiscent of Spotify or YouTube, where a subscription removes advertising.

## Impact on SEO and Organic Search

The arrival of **advertising in ChatGPT** redefines the rules of the game for search marketing professionals. If AI response engines become full-fledged advertising channels, traditional SEO strategies must evolve.

### The Fragmentation of Organic Traffic

Organic traffic, already threatened by Google's **AI Overviews** and direct responses from AI assistants, faces additional pressure. Ads in ChatGPT capture a share of the attention that would previously have generated a click to a website.

According to a Gartner study, **organic search traffic** could decline by **25% by 2026** due to the growing adoption of AI assistants. The addition of advertising in these interfaces accelerates this phenomenon.

### The Need for a GEO Strategy

Faced with this development, it is imperative to adopt a **GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)** approach. Optimization is no longer limited to ranking in traditional SERPs: you must now ensure that your content is **cited and recommended** by generative AIs.

To explore the fundamentals, it is recommended to consult the comprehensive guide on [what GEO is](/en/blog/what-is-geo/) and the methods to [optimize your content for generative AI](/en/blog/optimize-content-for-generative-ai/).

### Strengthened E-E-A-T Signals

In an environment where advertising coexists with organic responses, **authority and credibility signals** become even more decisive. Generative AIs rely on [E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)](/en/blog/e-e-a-t-and-geo/) criteria to distinguish reliable sources from promotional content. Strengthening these signals is therefore an absolute priority.

## GEO and AI Advertising: A New Deal for Brands

The convergence of **GEO** and **advertising in AI engines** creates a new marketing ecosystem. Brands now have two complementary levers to appear in conversational assistant responses.

### The Dual Lever: Organic + Paid

As with SEO/SEA on Google, it becomes possible to combine:

- **Organic GEO visibility**: optimizing your content to be naturally cited by ChatGPT
- **Paid visibility**: purchasing sponsored placements within responses

This complementarity mirrors the proven search marketing model, where organic results and paid ads coexist. Brands that master the [techniques to appear on ChatGPT](/en/blog/techniques-to-appear-on-chatgpt/) organically will have a competitive advantage, as the credibility of an organic mention remains superior to that of an ad.

### The Most Impacted Sectors

Some sectors will be more affected than others by the arrival of **ads on ChatGPT**:

- **E-commerce**: sponsored product recommendations in comparison-type responses
- **SaaS / Tech**: tool suggestions in technical responses
- **Finance / Insurance**: targeted ads on financial advice queries
- **Travel**: integration of sponsored results in planning responses
- **Healthcare**: sponsored inserts (with strict regulation) on medical queries

### The Importance of Structured Data

To maximize visibility, whether organic or paid, it is important to leverage **Schema.org structured data**. These tags enable AIs to better understand and extract information. A detailed guide on implementing [Schema.org structured data](/en/blog/structured-data-schema-org-guide/) is available on this blog.

## The Challenges and Limitations of ChatGPT's Ad Model

Despite the considerable opportunity, the introduction of **advertising in ChatGPT** raises fundamental questions about trust, transparency, and response quality.

### The Risk of Trust Erosion

ChatGPT's main asset is the **perception of neutrality** in its responses. The introduction of sponsored content risks undermining this trust. If users feel that recommendations are biased by commercial interests, adoption could slow down.

A 2025 Reuters/Ipsos survey shows that **67% of ChatGPT users** consider response neutrality an essential criterion for trust. The challenge for OpenAI is therefore to maintain this perception while integrating ad formats.

### Transparency and Regulation

Several regulatory challenges arise:

- **Clear identification** of sponsored content (FTC requirement in the United States)
- **Data protection**: contextual targeting must not violate GDPR-type regulations for a potential European rollout
- **Liability**: who is responsible if a sponsored recommendation misleads the user?
- **Fairness**: how to ensure that small businesses can also access this advertising channel?

### Response Quality at Stake

The technical challenge is considerable: integrating **relevant ads** without degrading response quality. A poor balance could push users toward alternatives like **Claude** (Anthropic), **Gemini** (Google), or **Perplexity**, which could capitalize on an "ad-free" positioning.

| Risk | Potential Impact | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------------|------------|
| Trust erosion | Decreased usage, churn to competitors | Transparency, clear labeling |
| Bias in responses | Media criticism, regulatory investigations | Strict separation of organic/paid |
| Ad saturation | Degraded user experience | Limiting the number of ads per conversation |
| Strict regulation | Targeting restrictions, transparency obligations | Proactive compliance, lobbying |

## Frequently Asked Questions
