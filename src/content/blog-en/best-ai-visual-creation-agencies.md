## Why AI visuals are transforming digital marketing

### The visual production revolution

In 2026, generative AI has transformed marketing visual creation:

- **Speed**: production in minutes vs days for a photo shoot or traditional graphic design
- **Cost**: 5 to 10 times cheaper than traditional visual production
- **Personalization**: unlimited variant generation for A/B testing and segment personalization
- **Accessibility**: professional-quality visuals now accessible to SMBs and startups

### AI visuals and GEO: an SEO advantage

Well-optimized visuals are a **visibility lever** in search engines and generative AI.

### The brand consistency challenge

The main challenge of generative AI is **maintaining brand visual consistency**. Agencies that master model fine-tuning on brand assets and AI guideline development ensure consistent visual identity across all productions.
