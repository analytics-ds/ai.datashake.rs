## Mobile SEO and ASO: Understanding the Challenges

### Two Complementary Disciplines

Mobile app visibility relies on **two distinct but complementary disciplines**:

**ASO (App Store Optimization)** optimizes visibility directly in stores:
- **Store keywords**: title, subtitle, keyword field (iOS), short and long description
- **Visuals**: icon, screenshots, preview video
- **Social proof**: ratings, reviews, download volume
- **Behavioral metrics**: store-listing-to-install conversion rate, retention, uninstalls

**Mobile SEO** optimizes visibility in search engines:
- **Google App Packs**: app results displayed in mobile SERPs
- **App Indexing**: indexation of in-app content by Google
- **App landing pages**: optimized web pages redirecting to the store
- **Deep linking**: deep links to specific in-app content
- **Structured data**: SoftwareApplication and MobileApplication markup

### The GEO Challenge for Mobile Apps

In 2026, a new challenge emerges: **[GEO](/en/blog/what-is-geo/)** (Generative Engine Optimization) for applications. Generative AIs increasingly recommend apps in their responses:

- **"What is the best meditation app?"** → ChatGPT, Perplexity and Google AI Overviews cite specific apps
- **"App to learn Japanese"** → AIs synthesize rankings with direct store links
- AI-referred traffic surged by **527%** year-over-year, and this trend now impacts app recommendations

To be cited by AIs as the "best app" in your category, you need to optimize web content (landing pages, feature pages) with **[structured data](/en/blog/structured-data-schema-org-guide/)** SoftwareApplication, strong **[E-E-A-T](/en/blog/e-e-a-t-and-geo/)** signals, and structured content that answers users' comparative queries.

### Why Combine Mobile SEO and ASO

Data shows that users discover apps through **multiple channels**:

- **70% of installs** come from store searches (ASO)
- **27% of store traffic** is referred by web search engines (mobile SEO)
- "Best app for..." queries on Google increased by **65%** between 2024 and 2026
- Generative AIs are becoming a fast-growing app recommendation channel

A siloed SEO or ASO strategy leaves a significant share of visibility untapped. The best-performing agencies combine both disciplines.

## Selection Criteria for a Mobile SEO / ASO Agency

### Essential Skills

- **ASO expertise**: store keyword research, metadata optimization, A/B testing on visuals, review management
- **Mobile technical SEO**: App Indexing, deep linking, SoftwareApplication structured data, mobile Core Web Vitals optimization
- **Data analysis**: ASO tracking tools (AppTweak, data.ai, Sensor Tower), multi-channel attribution
- **Mobile content strategy**: app landing pages, comparative pages, feature guides
- **GEO and AI**: optimization for app recommendations in AI responses
- **Store guidelines knowledge**: App Store Review Guidelines (Apple), Google Play Developer Policy

### Quality Signals to Verify

- **App portfolio** successfully optimized (store rankings, download metrics)
- **Documented case studies** with ASO and mobile SEO KPIs
- **Tools used**: professional ASO platform, not just manual estimates
- **Geographic coverage**: ability to optimize across multiple countries and languages
- **Continuous optimization approach**: ASO is not a one-shot, it's an iterative process
