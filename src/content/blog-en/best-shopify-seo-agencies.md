## Why Shopify SEO Requires Specific Expertise

### The Technical Specifics of Shopify

**Shopify** has become the dominant e-commerce platform with **26.2% of global e-commerce sites** and a projected revenue exceeding **$12 billion** in 2026. France is among the fastest-growing markets in terms of merchant adoption.

However, **organic search optimization on Shopify** presents technical constraints that set it apart from other CMS platforms. The platform imposes a **rigid URL structure** with `/collections/` and `/products/` prefixes, generates **duplicate pages** via URLs like `/collections/all/product-name`, and offers limited control over the `robots.txt` file and **XML sitemap**. The **Liquid** templating engine also requires specific knowledge to optimize semantic markup and [Schema.org structured data](/en/blog/structured-data-schema-org-guide/).

### The GEO Challenge for Shopify E-Commerce Merchants

Beyond traditional SEO, Shopify stores now face a new challenge: **GEO** (Generative Engine Optimization). In 2025, AI-referred traffic surged by **527%**, and brands cited in Google's AI Overviews receive **35% more organic clicks**. For e-commerce merchants, being referenced by generative AIs like ChatGPT or Perplexity is becoming a major growth lever. To explore this topic further, it is useful to consult our guide on [what GEO is](/en/blog/what-is-geo/).
