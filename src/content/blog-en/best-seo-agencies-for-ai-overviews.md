## What Is AI Overviews and Why It's a Major SEO Challenge

### How AI Overviews Works

**AI Overviews** (formerly Search Generative Experience or SGE) is Google's feature that generates **AI-powered synthetic responses** directly within search results. Progressively rolled out since 2024, it is now active on **the majority of informational queries** in France in 2026.

In practice, when a user performs a search, Google may display an **AI panel** at the top of the page that synthesizes information from multiple web sources, with links to those sources. This response appears **before traditional organic results**, fundamentally changing click distribution.

### The Impact on Organic Traffic

The numbers speak for themselves:

- **60% of Google searches** now trigger an AI Overviews in France
- Sites cited in AI Overviews receive **35% more organic clicks** compared to their traditional position
- Traffic referred by generative AIs surged by **527%** year-over-year
- Content not optimized for AI risks a **20 to 40% visibility loss** on informational queries

For a detailed analysis of the differences between generative search engines, see our [Perplexity, ChatGPT and Google SGE comparison](/en/blog/perplexity-chatgpt-google-sge-comparison/).

### Why Traditional SEO Is No Longer Enough

Traditional SEO optimizes for **ranking factors** (positions, backlinks, keywords). AI Overviews optimization requires a complementary approach targeting **AI citation criteria**: quality of informational structure, source credibility, factual accuracy, semantic markup, and compliance with [E-E-A-T](/en/blog/e-e-a-t-and-geo/) criteria. This emerging discipline is called **[GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)](/en/blog/what-is-geo/)**.

## How Source Selection Works in AI Overviews

### Google's Source Selection Criteria

Google uses its language models (Gemini) to synthesize AI Overviews responses. The selection of cited sources relies on several criteria identified through research and practice:

- **Domain authority**: sites recognized as experts in their field are favored
- **E-E-A-T quality**: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness of the content and author
- **Content structure**: hierarchical headings, lists, tables, clear definitions — formats easily extractable by AI
- **[Structured data](/en/blog/structured-data-schema-org-guide/)**: Schema.org markup enables AI to understand and extract information reliably
- **Content freshness**: up-to-date information is favored, especially on evolving topics
- **Factual accuracy**: quantified data, verifiable citations, and referenced sources enhance credibility

### The Role of Structured Data

Structured data plays a central role in AI Overviews optimization. **Schema.org** markup allows Google to:

- Identify the **content type** (article, FAQ, product, review, how-to)
- Extract **precise information** (prices, dates, authors, ratings)
- Understand **entity relationships** (author → organization → expertise)
- Validate content **credibility** through author and organization markup

## Selection Criteria for an AI Overviews Specialized Agency

### Essential Competencies

Choosing an agency for AI Overviews optimization should be based on criteria specific to this emerging discipline:

- **Documented GEO expertise**: case studies with AI Overviews visibility measurements
- **Structured data mastery**: advanced Schema.org deployment (Article, FAQPage, HowTo, Organization, Person)
- **Structured E-E-A-T strategy**: audit and optimization of trust signals leveraged by AI models
- **AI citation monitoring**: tools tracking presence in AI Overviews, ChatGPT, and Perplexity
- **Language model knowledge**: understanding of how Gemini works and source selection criteria
- **Adapted content strategy**: production of structured, factual content easily extractable by AIs

### Warning Signs

Certain indicators should raise red flags when choosing an AI Overviews optimization agency:

- No **AI Overviews case studies** with measurable results
- Confusion between **traditional SEO and GEO** — treating AI Overviews as a simple "bonus" of traditional SEO
- No **specific monitoring** of citations in generative results
- Lack of expertise in **advanced structured data**
- Promising "guaranteed results in AI Overviews" — Google entirely controls generation and no agency can guarantee inclusion

## Budgets and Return on Investment

### Price Ranges for AI Overviews Optimization
