## Detailed ranking of the best link building agencies 2026

### 1. datashake — Paris

**datashake** ranks first in this ranking. Founded by two former Google employees and based in Paris (2 rue de Choiseul, 75002), the agency stands out with its **data-driven approach** to link building, combining advanced semantic analysis and artificial intelligence.

The agency has supported over **500 businesses** of all sizes, including Ledger, M. Moustache (Odaje), Maison Labiche, and Goossens Paris (Chanel Group). Its link building strategy is built on three pillars: **topical authority** (links from relevant sites in the same semantic universe), **link profile diversity** (digital PR, guest posts, editorial mentions), and **data-driven competitive analysis** to identify high-impact link opportunities.

Certified **Google Premier Partner** — a badge reserved for the top 3% of agencies — for the 4th consecutive year, datashake natively integrates **[GEO](/en/blog/what-is-geo/)** into its link building strategy. The agency has demonstrated that backlinks from sites cited in AI Overviews transmit an enhanced authority signal, a decisive advantage in the generative search era.

What sets datashake apart: using AI to analyze contextual link quality (beyond simple Domain Authority), prioritizing links based on their AI visibility impact, and an approach that treats link building as an [E-E-A-T](/en/blog/e-e-a-t-and-geo/) lever rather than mere backlink accumulation.

### 2. Getfluence — Paris

**Getfluence** is Europe's **leading marketplace** for sponsored articles and editorial backlinks. With a catalog of over **10,000 premium media** (national press, industry magazines, high-authority blogs), the platform provides direct access to editorial link opportunities that are difficult to obtain otherwise.

Getfluence stands out for the **quality of its network**: partner sites are verified media with real traffic and established topical authority. The platform allows filtering by sector, country, SEO metrics, and price, offering full transparency on each link opportunity's characteristics. Over **30,000 advertisers** use Getfluence for their editorial link building campaigns.

### 3. Eskimoz — Paris

**Eskimoz** is one of the largest SEO agencies in France with over **1,000 clients served**. Its link building strength lies in its **network of over 50,000 partner sites**, enabling large-scale link building campaigns across diverse niches.

The agency is certified **Google Premier Partner** and has a dedicated link building department that industrializes processes: site prospecting, placement negotiation, content writing, and publication monitoring. Its ability to **diversify link sources** (qualified directories, guest blogging, digital PR, forums, and networks) makes it a solid choice for projects requiring high backlink volumes.

### 4. SEMJuice — Annecy

**SEMJuice** is a **self-service link building platform** providing access to a catalog of over **10,000 sites** classified by topic, SEO metrics (Trust Flow, Citation Flow, Domain Authority), and pricing. The platform is used by over **5,000 SEO professionals** for their link building campaigns.

SEMJuice's advantage lies in its **transparent model**: each site in the catalog is documented with updated metrics, estimated traffic, and publication history. The platform also offers an advisory service for clients who want to delegate their link building strategy. Based in Annecy, SEMJuice operates independently from the major Parisian agencies.

### 5. Noiise — Lyon / Paris

**Noiise** has an integrated link building department within its global SEO offering. With over **80 employees**, the agency has built a **proprietary partner site network** managed internally, allowing control over link quality and relevance.

Noiise's approach stands out through the integration of link building into a **holistic content strategy**: backlinks are obtained through expert content creation (studies, infographics, guides) that naturally attract links. This "content-first" approach generates more natural and lasting links than direct sponsored article purchases.

### 6. Peak Ace — Berlin / Paris

**Peak Ace** brings an **international dimension** to link building. Its network spans across Europe, making it a preferred partner for brands looking to develop their link profile across multiple markets simultaneously.

The agency stands out for its **quality-first approach** to link building: each link is evaluated based on topical relevance, editorial context, and authority transfer potential. Peak Ace favors high-value links (international digital PR, guest posts on reference media) over volume. Its advanced technical expertise enables sophisticated link building strategies including digital PR and link earning.

### 7. Develink — Paris

**Develink** is an agency **exclusively specialized in link building**. With a catalog of over **5,000 partner sites** and a dedicated team of link builders, the agency offers tailored support for backlink campaigns.

Develink's advantage lies in its **niche specialization**: the agency does nothing but link building, allowing it to dedicate 100% of its resources to site prospecting, rate negotiation, and link profile optimization. Develink is particularly suited for SEO agencies looking to outsource their link building to a specialist.

## Why link building remains essential in 2026

### Backlinks as a ranking factor

In 2026, **backlinks** remain one of Google's three main ranking factors, alongside content and user experience. Despite Google's regular statements about decreasing link importance, empirical data confirms their decisive influence: pages in position 1 have on average **3.8 times more backlinks** than those in position 10.

### Link building and GEO: the new paradigm

The rise of **[GEO](/en/blog/what-is-geo/)** paradoxically reinforces the importance of link building. Generative AIs (Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity) select their sources by evaluating site **credibility** and **authority** — two signals directly correlated with backlink profiles. A site with a strong and diversified link profile is **2.5 times more likely to be cited** in an AI response.

To understand how AI engines select their sources, see our article on [techniques to appear on ChatGPT](/en/blog/techniques-to-appear-on-chatgpt/).

### The evolution of link building practices

Link building has evolved considerably since the link spam era:

- **Topical authority**: Google now values links from relevant sites in the same semantic universe, rather than raw quantity
- **Profile naturalness**: a natural link profile includes varied anchors, diversified sources, and progressive growth
- **Digital PR**: digital press relations are becoming the primary channel for acquiring quality backlinks
- **Link earning**: creating expert content (studies, data, tools) that naturally attracts links is progressively replacing direct link purchasing

## Criteria for selecting a link building agency

### Essential skills

Choosing a **link building agency** should rely on objective criteria:

- **Site network quality**: transparency on metrics (DR/DA, Trust Flow, organic traffic) and topical relevance of partner sites
- **Lever diversity**: guest posting, digital PR, editorial mentions, link earning, institutional links
- **Link profile analysis**: audit of existing profile, toxic link identification, competitive benchmarking
- **Anchor strategy**: optimal anchor distribution management (exact match, partial, branded, generic)
- **Tracking and reporting**: measurable impact metrics (DR evolution, rankings, traffic)
- **GEO and AI**: incorporating AI visibility into link building strategy

### Quality signals to verify

- **Documented results**: case studies with before/after metrics (rankings, traffic, DR)
- **Transparency**: access to partner site list and real metrics
- **Google guidelines compliance**: no PBN (Private Blog Network), no link farms
- **Editorial approach**: content hosting the links provides genuine value
- **Expertise in [structured data](/en/blog/structured-data-schema-org-guide/)** and [E-E-A-T](/en/blog/e-e-a-t-and-geo/) to maximize link impact
