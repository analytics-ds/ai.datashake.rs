## Understanding how ChatGPT selects its sources

Before applying any **technique to appear on ChatGPT**, it is essential to understand how the model works. ChatGPT generates its responses from two mechanisms: **training data** (a massive corpus of text) and **real-time web browsing** via search plugins (Bing, browse with Bing).

### The role of training data

GPT models are trained on billions of web pages, books and documents. Content that is regularly cited, shared and referenced has a greater chance of being included in the **training data** of future model versions. According to OpenAI, GPT-4 was trained on a corpus with a cutoff date of April 2024, but subsequent versions incorporate more recent data.

### Real-time search

Since 2024, ChatGPT can browse the web in real time to supplement its responses. This mechanism relies on Bing indexing. It is therefore essential that content is:

- **Indexed by Bing** (and not only Google)
- **Technically accessible** (no blocking by robots.txt or heavy JavaScript)
- **Clearly structured** to facilitate information extraction

To fully grasp the fundamentals of this new approach, it is recommended to consult the comprehensive guide on [what GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) is](/en/blog/what-is-geo/).

## Optimizing your content structure and markup

The most direct **technique to appear on ChatGPT** is to structure your content in a way that facilitates extraction by AI. Well-marked-up content is more easily identifiable, understandable and citable.

### Schema.org structured data

**JSON-LD** markup with Schema.org allows algorithms to precisely identify the entities, relationships and factual information on a page. The most relevant markup types for GEO are:

| Schema.org Type | Usefulness for ChatGPT | Priority |
|----------------|----------------------|----------|
| `Article` | Identifies editorial content, author, date | High |
| `FAQPage` | Structures questions/answers for direct extraction | High |
| `HowTo` | Details the steps of a process | Medium |
| `Organization` / `Person` | Establishes the identity and authority of the author | High |
| `BreadcrumbList` | Clarifies the site hierarchy | Medium |

For a detailed implementation, it is useful to consult the guide on [structured data and Schema.org](/en/blog/structured-data-schema-org-guide/).

### Heading hierarchy and accessibility

AI engines primarily extract information located in **H2/H3 headings**, **bullet lists**, **tables** and the **first paragraphs** of each section. A clear hierarchy allows AI to understand the logical structure of the content and extract precise answers from it.

> "The content best cited by generative AIs is that which directly answers a question, in a structured and factual format, from the very first lines of a section."
> — Rand Fishkin, founder of SparkToro

### Technical site optimization

Beyond content, **technical performance** plays an indirect role. A fast, mobile-friendly and accessible site facilitates crawling by Bing and improves the probability of being indexed in the search results used by ChatGPT.

- **Loading time** under 2.5 seconds (Core Web Vitals)
- Complete **mobile compatibility**
- **robots.txt file** allowing crawling by Bingbot and GPTBot
- Up-to-date **XML sitemap** submitted to Bing Webmaster Tools

## Creating content designed to be cited by AI

The quality and format of content constitute the most decisive **technique to appear on ChatGPT**. AI favors factual, sourced and directly usable content.

### Writing direct answers

ChatGPT seeks to provide clear and concise answers. Content that begins each section with a **definition** or a **direct answer** to the implicit question of the heading is more likely to be cited. Essential information should be placed in the **first 50 words** of each section.

### Incorporating numerical data and sources

Generative AIs place particular importance on **verifiable data**. According to a Zyppy study (2024), pages containing **sourced statistics** are cited **40% more often** by language models than pages without numerical data. It is recommended to include:

- **Recent statistics** with year and source
- **Numerical comparisons** in table format
- **Expert quotes** with clear attribution

### Adopting an expert and impersonal tone

The writing tone influences AI's perception of reliability. Content written in an **expert, factual and impersonal tone** is more likely to be considered a reference source. Promotional wording should be avoided in favor of claims supported by evidence. To explore this topic further, the article on [content optimization for generative AI](/en/blog/optimize-content-for-generative-ai/) details best writing practices.

## Strengthening your authority and credibility

The **technique to appear on ChatGPT** is not limited to the content of a single page. AI evaluates the **overall credibility** of the source before citing it.

### E-E-A-T and authority signals

Google and AI systems share the same quality evaluation criteria: **Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trustworthiness** (E-E-A-T). A site whose author is identified, whose articles are sourced and whose domain carries authority will be favored by ChatGPT. The article on [E-E-A-T and GEO](/en/blog/e-e-a-t-and-geo/) explains how to strengthen these signals.

### Building a solid backlink profile

**Backlinks** remain a major authority signal. Sites frequently cited by other quality sources are perceived as more reliable by AI models. According to Ahrefs, pages ranking in Google's top 10 have on average **3.8 times more backlinks** than those in positions 11 to 100.

| Authority signal | Impact on ChatGPT | Recommended action |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Backlinks from .edu / .gov sites | High | Press relations, academic publications |
| Citations in specialized press | High | Guest posting, interviews |
| Complete author profile (Schema.org Person) | Medium | JSON-LD markup, dedicated author page |
| Domain age | Moderate | Publish regularly on an established domain |
| Unlinked brand mentions | Moderate | Monitoring and link reclamation |

### Presence on platforms indexed by AI

ChatGPT relies on various sources. It is relevant to publish content on platforms that are regularly indexed: **Wikipedia** (sourced contributions), **Reddit** (expert discussions), **Stack Overflow** (technical answers), **Medium** and **specialized forums**. These platforms carry significant weight in the training data of GPT models.

## Distribution and visibility strategy

Publishing quality content is not enough. You must ensure that this content is **discovered, indexed and referenced** by the systems that feed ChatGPT.

### Submitting your site to Bing and authorizing GPTBot

ChatGPT primarily uses **Bing** for its web search. It is essential to:

- Create a **Bing Webmaster Tools** account and submit your sitemap
- Verify that the **robots.txt** allows the `Bingbot` and `GPTBot` user agents
- Add an **llms.txt** file at the root of the site to inform AIs of the available content

### Publishing regularly and updating

Publishing frequency and **content freshness** are selection criteria. A blog that publishes **2 to 4 articles per month** and updates its existing content sends a signal of ongoing reliability. According to HubSpot, companies publishing more than **16 articles per month** generate **3.5 times more traffic** than those publishing fewer than 4.

### Optimizing for multiple AI engines

ChatGPT is not the only AI answer engine. You should optimize simultaneously for **Perplexity AI**, **Google SGE** and **Claude**. The [comparison of AI engines Perplexity, ChatGPT and Google SGE](/en/blog/perplexity-chatgpt-google-sge-comparison/) helps understand the indexing differences between these platforms.

## Measuring and iterating on your presence in ChatGPT

Applying a **technique to appear on ChatGPT** without measuring results is like navigating without a compass. It is essential to put monitoring in place.

### Monitoring tools

There is no official tool yet to measure visibility in ChatGPT, but several approaches allow you to assess your presence:

- **Manually test** queries related to your domain in ChatGPT and note whether your site is cited
- Use tools such as **Originality.ai** or **Knowatoa** that analyze AI citations
- Track traffic from the **chatgpt.com referrer** in Google Analytics or equivalent
- Monitor Bing indexing via **Bing Webmaster Tools**

### Iterate and improve

AI algorithms evolve rapidly. It is recommended to review your strategy **every quarter**: update the best-performing articles, add recent numerical data, strengthen structured markup and publish new content on emerging topics. Understanding the fundamentals of [artificial intelligence](/en/blog/understanding-artificial-intelligence/) helps anticipate the technical evolution of models.

### Mistakes to avoid

Certain practices are counterproductive and risk harming visibility:

- **Duplicate content** or mass-generated content without added value
- **Keyword stuffing** and over-optimization
- **Blocking GPTBot** in robots.txt
- **Absence of structured markup** and author metadata
- **Unsourced** or outdated information
