### 5. Lunio — Manchester (SaaS Tool)

## Why optimizing Google Ads spending is crucial in 2026

### CPC inflation

The **average cost per click** on Google Ads has increased by **15 to 20%** between 2024 and 2026 across most industries. This inflation is driven by growing competition, massive adoption of automated bidding, and reduced ad space in favor of AI Overviews.

### SEO/SEA complementarity as a savings lever

One of the most powerful savings levers is the **synergy between SEO and Google Ads**. By identifying keywords where the site already ranks organically (or can rank via [GEO](/en/blog/what-is-geo/)), it's possible to reduce Ads bids on these queries — or even remove them — and reallocate budget to queries where only SEA is competitive.

### AI Overviews impact on Google Ads

Google's **AI Overviews** are changing the advertising landscape: generative results take up SERP space, reducing classic ad visibility. Brands investing in [GEO](/en/blog/what-is-geo/) to appear in these AI responses mechanically reduce their Ads dependency for these queries. To learn more, see our article on [techniques to appear on ChatGPT](/en/blog/techniques-to-appear-on-chatgpt/).

## Key cost-saving levers on Google Ads

### 1. Quality Score optimization

**Quality Score** is the #1 cost reduction lever. A Quality Score of 10/10 reduces CPC by **50%** compared to an average score of 5/10. Improvement areas:

- Ad relevance to keywords
- Landing page quality and speed
- Expected click-through rate (CTR)

### 2. Search term exclusions

Regularly adding **negative keywords** eliminates clicks on irrelevant queries. A well-managed account excludes an average of **200 to 500 terms** per month, saving 10 to 25% of budget.

### 3. Click fraud protection

**Click fraud** represents 12 to 15% of Ads budgets. Tools like Lunio or ClickCease block invalid traffic and recover that budget share.

### 4. Smart bidding strategies

Google's automated bidding strategies (Target CPA, Target ROAS, Maximize Conversions) optimize bids in real time but require reliable conversion data and expert setup.

### 5. SEO/SEA synergy

Covering the most expensive Ads queries **organically** allows reducing or removing bids on those keywords. This is the most structural and lasting saving.
