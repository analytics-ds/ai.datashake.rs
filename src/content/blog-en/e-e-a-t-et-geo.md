## Understanding E-E-A-T in the Context of GEO

### Definition of E-E-A-T

**E-E-A-T** stands for **Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness**. This evaluation framework, defined by Google in its *Search Quality Rater Guidelines*, serves as the reference for assessing the quality of content and the credibility of its source.

Originally designed for **traditional SEO**, E-E-A-T takes on a new dimension with the rise of **GEO** (Generative Engine Optimization). To understand the fundamentals of GEO, it is useful to consult our comprehensive guide on [what GEO is](/en/blog/qu-est-ce-que-le-geo/).

### From SEO to GEO: A Paradigm Shift

The transition from SEO to GEO radically changes how content is selected and presented. In traditional SEO, the goal is to appear in Google's **10 blue links**. In GEO, the challenge is to be **directly cited** in responses generated by AIs like ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Google AI Overviews.

In this context, **LLMs only cite an average of 2 to 7 domains per response**, far fewer than the 10 results on a traditional search page. The competition to be selected as a reliable source is therefore significantly more intense — and E-E-A-T becomes the decisive criterion.

## The Four Pillars of E-E-A-T Applied to GEO

### Experience

Generative AI values content that demonstrates **concrete, verifiable experience** with the subject matter. Simply rephrasing existing information is no longer enough. Experience signals include:

- **Case studies** drawn from real-world situations
- **Field-based feedback** with proprietary data
- **Practical examples** that are documented and dated
- **Direct observations** supported by measurable results

Content that states "based on an analysis of 200 campaigns conducted in 2025" will systematically carry more weight than a purely theoretical article in the eyes of a language model.

### Expertise

Expertise manifests through **technical depth** and **factual accuracy** of the content. Generative AIs favor sources that demonstrate genuine mastery of the subject:

- Correct use of **domain-specific technical vocabulary**
- Ability to present **nuances and subtleties** in the analysis
- **Quantified data** and verifiable statistics
- Knowledge of the **latest developments** in the field

According to a BrightEdge study, pages written by identified experts with **detailed biographies** and verifiable qualifications achieve significantly higher AI citation rates.

### Authoritativeness

Authority is built through **external recognition** and consistency of editorial presence. In GEO, **brand search volume** has become the strongest predictor of AI citation, with a correlation of **0.334** — even ahead of traditional backlinks.

| Authority Signal | Impact on AI Citation |
|---|---|
| Brand search volume | Strongest correlation (0.334) |
| Citations by third-party sources | Strengthens perceived credibility by LLMs |
| Consistent presence on the topic | Favors selection as a reference source |
| Author profiles with qualifications | Trust signal for RAG systems |

### Trustworthiness

Trustworthiness is considered the **central pillar** of E-E-A-T, the one that encompasses all others. It relies on the **transparency** and **verifiability** of information:

- **Cited sources** that are traceable
- **Publication and update dates** clearly visible
- **Factual information** that is accurate and up-to-date
- **Transparency** about the identity of the author and the organization

> "RAG systems retrieve sources, synthesize them, and sometimes cite them. The competition is no longer about who ranks, but about who becomes the source. Without reliability, no retrieval. Without clarity, no usage. Without accuracy, no citation."
> — The Digital Bloom, *2025 AI Visibility Report*

## Why E-E-A-T Dominates AI Source Selection

### Key AI Visibility Figures

The importance of E-E-A-T in **GEO** is confirmed by recent data. In 2025, **more than 50% of Google searches** display an AI Overview, and **1.5 billion monthly users** interact with these enriched results. Meanwhile, AI-referred sessions surged by **527%** between January and May 2025.

This transformation creates a new reality: **60% of searches** now end without a click (zero-click), and the click-through rate in position 1 with an AI Overview is only **2.6%**. To explore the impact of these changes across different AI platforms, it is worth consulting the [comparison between Perplexity, ChatGPT, and Google SGE](/en/blog/perplexity-chatgpt-google-sge-comparatif/).

### The E-E-A-T Filter of Language Models

Language models do not treat all sources equally. **99% of AI Overviews** cite pages from the organic top 10, and **87% of ChatGPT citations** correspond to the top Bing results. E-E-A-T acts as a **selection filter**: among well-positioned pages, only those that demonstrate high expertise and reliability are actually cited.

Princeton research on GEO confirms that optimization methods related to E-E-A-T — **citing sources, integrating statistics, including expert quotes** — can improve AI visibility by **30 to 40%** compared to non-optimized content.

### Divergence Between AI Platforms

A critical point to understand: each AI platform has its own source selection criteria. Only **11% of domains** are cited by both ChatGPT and Perplexity.

| Platform | Preferred Sources | Dominant Criterion |
|---|---|---|
| Google AI Overviews | Diversified cross-platform presence | Domain authority and trustworthiness |
| ChatGPT | Wikipedia, parametric knowledge | Expertise and brand awareness |
| Perplexity | Reddit content, real-time sources | User experience and freshness |

## Concrete Strategies to Strengthen Your E-E-A-T for GEO

### Detailed and Marked-Up Author Profiles

Each piece of content must be attributed to a **clearly identified author**. Organizations that associated each response with a named expert and added detailed biographies saw an increase of **12 to 15% in session duration** according to Deloitte Insights. The essential elements:

- **Full name**, role, and professional qualifications
- **Biography** detailing experience in the field
- **Verifiable links** to professional profiles (LinkedIn, publications)
- **Schema.org markup** of type `Person` or `Organization`

### Regular Publishing and Content Updates

Generative AI favors sources that publish **regularly** within their area of expertise. A consistent editorial calendar and systematic updating of existing content strengthen the perception of reliability. It is recommended to:

- Maintain a **stable publishing frequency**
- **Update existing articles** with the latest data
- Clearly indicate **update dates** via the `dateModified` property
- Build **comprehensive topical coverage** around your domain

### Optimizing Content for AI Extraction

Content structured to facilitate extraction by LLMs achieves better results. Techniques for [optimizing content for generative AI](/en/blog/optimiser-contenu-ia-generative/) include the use of lists, tables, and clear summaries.

According to available data, tactical changes such as adding **precise statistics** and **structured answers** can impact visibility in as little as **30 to 45 days**.

## E-E-A-T and Structured Data: The Technical Lever

### The Role of Schema.org in E-E-A-T

**Structured data** constitutes the technical bridge between E-E-A-T and GEO. Pages implementing complete Schema.org markup have approximately **a one-third greater chance** of being cited in AI responses. In 2025, **85% of businesses** plan to increase their investment in structured data to improve their AI visibility.

The most impactful markup types for E-E-A-T are:

- **`Article`** with `author`, `datePublished`, `dateModified`
- **`Person`** for author profiles with `sameAs` and `jobTitle`
- **`Organization`** with `foundingDate`, `areaServed`, `knowsAbout`
- **`FAQPage`** for structured frequently asked questions
- **`BreadcrumbList`** for contextual navigation

For a detailed guide on technical implementation, it is recommended to consult our [comprehensive guide on Schema.org structured data](/en/blog/donnees-structurees-schema-org-guide/).

### Implementing E-E-A-T Signals in Schema.org

The goal is to make **machine-readable** the E-E-A-T signals that are visible to users. Each article should include JSON-LD markup incorporating:

- The **author's identity** with their qualifications
- The **publication date** and last modification date
- The **publishing organization** and its area of expertise
- **Cited sources** when relevant

Content detected as "GEO-ready" thanks to this markup is discovered up to **10 times faster** by generative engines compared to organic SEO alone.

## Measuring and Auditing Your E-E-A-T for GEO

### E-E-A-T Performance Indicators

There is no **official E-E-A-T score** provided by Google or AI platforms. However, several indicators allow you to indirectly evaluate the quality of your E-E-A-T in a GEO context:

| Indicator | What It Measures | Recommended Tool |
|---|---|---|
| AI citations | Number of times the domain is cited in AI responses | Specialized GEO tracking tools |
| Brand search volume | Perceived awareness and authority | Google Trends, Search Console |
| AI-referred traffic | Visits coming from AI platforms | Google Analytics (source/medium) |
| Citation rate vs. impressions | E-E-A-T effectiveness | Cross-analysis of data |

### E-E-A-T Audit: Essential Questions

To assess the strength of your **E-E-A-T** with GEO in mind, you should ask yourself the following questions:

- Are **authors** clearly identified with verifiable biographies?
- Are **sources** systematically cited and traceable?
- Is the content **regularly updated** with visible dates?
- Is the site **cited by other authoritative sources** in its domain?
- Is **Schema.org structured data** correctly implemented?
- Is **topical coverage** sufficiently deep and consistent?

In 2025, only **23% of marketers** invest in prompt tracking and GEO measurement. This represents a **considerable opportunity** for those who structure their E-E-A-T approach now. To understand the fundamentals of [artificial intelligence](/en/blog/comprendre-l-intelligence-artificielle/) and its impact on search, it is essential to continuously follow industry developments.
