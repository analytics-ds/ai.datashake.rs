## The Generative Search Engine Landscape

The online search market is undergoing its greatest transformation since the emergence of Google. Several players now offer **search engines powered by generative AI**, each with its own approach to selecting, synthesizing and citing sources.

Understanding the specifics of each engine is essential to adapting your GEO strategy.

## Google SGE (Search Generative Experience)

### How It Works

Google SGE integrates generative responses directly into traditional search results. For certain queries, an AI panel appears at the top of the page, providing a summary with links to the sources used.

### Source Selection

Google SGE relies on:

- The **existing Google index** and traditional ranking signals
- **Structured data** to understand content
- **E-E-A-T** criteria to assess reliability
- Content **freshness** for current topics

### Key Points for GEO

- Traditional SEO remains important because SGE uses the same index
- Schema.org structured data has a direct impact
- Content already well-positioned in the SERPs has an advantage
- Rich results (featured snippets, FAQ) increase the chances of being cited

## Perplexity AI

### How It Works

Perplexity is a conversational search engine that provides sourced answers with **numbered citations** linking directly to the web pages used. It is the tool that most explicitly cites its sources.

### Source Selection

Perplexity uses:

- A **proprietary web crawler** in addition to search results
- A **semantic relevance** analysis of content
- **Source reliability** (recognized, institutional and expert sites)
- Information **freshness**

### Key Points for GEO

- Perplexity particularly values **factual and sourced** content
- Articles with **numerical data** are more likely to be cited
- **Content structure** (clear headings, lists, tables) facilitates extraction
- Being a **recognized source in your niche** is a major advantage

## ChatGPT (with Web Browsing)

### How It Works

ChatGPT, when using web browsing, performs searches to supplement its responses with current information. It synthesizes results and can cite the sources used.

### Source Selection

ChatGPT with web browsing:

- Uses **Bing results** as its search base
- Selects pages based on their **relevance** to the query
- Extracts the most **directly usable** information
- Can access full page content for in-depth analysis

### Key Points for GEO

- Optimization for **Bing** is important (submit your sitemap to Bing Webmaster Tools)
- **Well-structured** content with direct answers is favored
- **Brand authority** influences selection
- **Long and detailed** content is preferred for complex responses

## Comparative Table

| Criterion | Google SGE | Perplexity | ChatGPT (web) |
|-----------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **Index base** | Google index | Own crawler + search | Bing |
| **Source citation** | Integrated links | Numbered citations | Contextual links |
| **Importance of traditional SEO** | Very high | Medium | High (Bing) |
| **Structured data** | High impact | Medium impact | Low impact |
| **Favored content type** | Rich results | Factual content | Detailed content |
| **Freshness** | Important | Very important | Variable |
| **Market share** | Dominant | Growing | Significant |

## Multi-Platform Strategy

Rather than optimizing for a single AI engine, adopt a **universal** approach that covers the common fundamentals:

1. **Quality content**: depth, expertise, cited sources
2. **Structured data**: Schema.org for Article, Author, FAQ, Breadcrumb
3. **Broad indexation**: submit your sitemap to both Google AND Bing
4. **Clear structure**: hierarchical headings, lists, tables, summaries
5. **Freshness**: update regularly with the most recent information
6. **E-E-A-T**: author profiles, about page, reliable sources

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Which AI engine generates the most traffic?**

Google SGE, due to its dominant position in search, is the most significant potential source of traffic. However, Perplexity is experiencing rapid growth and generates highly qualified traffic thanks to its direct citations.

**Should you create different content for each AI engine?**

No. The fundamental principles (quality, structure, sources) are shared. Focus on creating excellent, well-structured content — it will naturally be well-handled by all engines.

**Will AI engines replace Google?**

A complete replacement in the short term is unlikely. The most probable scenario is a coexistence where Google increasingly integrates AI (SGE) while retaining traditional results, and where alternatives like Perplexity capture a growing share of certain types of queries.
