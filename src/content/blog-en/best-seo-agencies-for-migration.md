## Why a Site Migration Requires an SEO Expert

### The Risks of a Poorly Managed Migration

A site migration represents one of the most critical moments for organic search. According to an Ahrefs study, **more than 60% of poorly prepared migrations result in significant organic traffic loss**, sometimes exceeding 30%, with recovery that can take 6 to 12 months — or may never fully occur.

The most common mistakes include:

- **Missing or incorrect redirects**: every URL that changes must have a 301 redirect to its exact equivalent
- **Internal linking loss**: broken internal links after migration destroy internal PageRank flow
- **Unintentional content changes**: modified texts, title tags, and meta descriptions trigger a Google reassessment
- **Indexation issues**: residual noindex tags, blocking robots.txt, or outdated XML sitemap
- **Loss of [structured data](/en/blog/structured-data-schema-org-guide/)**: unmigrated Schema.org markup reduces visibility in rich results and AI responses

### The GEO Challenge in a Migration

In 2026, a poorly managed migration doesn't just affect positioning in Google's classic results. It also impacts **visibility in generative search engines** like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews. Generative AIs index and memorize source URLs: if these return 404 errors after migration, content is gradually de-indexed from AI knowledge bases.

A migration-specialized SEO expert ensures that **[E-E-A-T](/en/blog/e-e-a-t-and-geo/) signals** are preserved, structured data is correctly transposed, and URLs cited by AIs continue to function via appropriate redirects. To understand how AIs select their sources, refer to our guide on [techniques to appear on ChatGPT](/en/blog/techniques-to-appear-on-chatgpt/).

## The Different Types of Migrations

### Domain Migration

Changing the domain name (e.g., `old-site.com` → `new-site.com`) is the riskiest migration because it involves a **complete transfer of domain authority**. Google must reassociate all trust signals — backlinks, history, authority — with the new domain. This type of migration requires rigorous use of the **Change of Address** tool in Google Search Console and an exhaustive 301 redirect plan.

### CMS / Platform Migration

Changing platforms (e.g., Prestashop to Shopify, WordPress to headless) typically modifies the **URL structure**, page templates, and sometimes the content itself. The difficulty lies in mapping between old and new URLs, which often follow radically different logic depending on the CMS.

### HTTP to HTTPS Migration

Although now standard, switching to HTTPS remains a full-fledged technical migration. Every HTTP URL must be redirected to its HTTPS equivalent, and all internal resources (images, scripts, CSS) must be served over HTTPS to avoid mixed content.

### Redesign with Architecture Change

Restructuring the site architecture — merging categories, modifying semantic silos, changing navigation depth — is often the most impactful migration for SEO. It modifies the **internal PageRank distribution** and can affect the positioning of hundreds of pages simultaneously.

### Site Merger or Separation

Consolidating multiple domains into one (or vice versa) involves complex strategic choices: which domain to keep, how to handle duplicate content between source sites, and how to redistribute backlink authority.

## Selection Criteria for an SEO Migration Agency

### Essential Competencies

Choosing an SEO agency for a migration should be based on criteria specific to this type of project:

- **Documented migration experience**: case studies with before/after traffic data
- **Advanced technical mastery**: crawling, log analysis, large-scale redirect management
- **Multi-CMS knowledge**: understanding of both source and target platforms
- **Structured methodology**: phased process with milestones and validation criteria
- **Post-migration monitoring capability**: tools and responsiveness to detect and correct anomalies quickly
- **GEO expertise**: preserving visibility in generative AI search engines

### Warning Signs

Certain indicators should raise red flags when choosing a migration agency:

- No specific **migration case studies** with quantified results
- No **pre-migration audit** phase in the proposal
- No structured **post-migration monitoring** mentioned
- Promising "migration with absolutely no traffic loss" — a migration always involves an adjustment period, and an honest partner explains this clearly
- No coordination planned with the client's **development teams**

## Budgets and Return on Investment

### Price Ranges for an SEO Migration

Budgets vary based on project complexity, number of URLs to migrate, and desired support level:

| Migration Type | Estimated Budget | Project Duration |
|---|---|---|
| Simple migration (< 500 URLs) | €5,000 – €10,000 | 1 to 2 months |
| Medium migration (500 – 5,000 URLs) | €10,000 – €25,000 | 2 to 4 months |
| Complex migration (5,000 – 50,000 URLs) | €25,000 – €50,000 | 3 to 6 months |
| E-commerce migration (50,000+ URLs) | €50,000 – €100,000+ | 4 to 8 months |
| Post-migration monitoring (recurring) | €2,000 – €5,000/month | 3 to 6 months |

### The Cost of Inaction

Not investing in specialized SEO support during a migration can cost significantly more than the agency's fee. A **30% loss of organic traffic** on a site generating €100,000 in monthly revenue via SEO represents a loss of **€360,000 per year** — not counting recovery costs. Relative to the budget of a specialized agency, the **ROI of migration support is typically greater than 5x**.

## SEO Migration Checklist: Key Steps

### Phase 1 — Pre-Migration Audit

- Export of organic positions and traffic by URL
- Backlink inventory by landing page

- Identification of high-SEO-value pages (traffic, positions, backlinks)

### Phase 2 — Preparation

- Comprehensive URL mapping: old URL → new URL

### Phase 3 — Launch

### Phase 4 — Post-Migration Monitoring

Choosing an SEO agency for a migration is a strategic investment whose impact is measured over several years. In a context where AI search engines are redefining content discovery, selecting a partner who masters both **technical SEO** and **[GEO](/en/blog/what-is-geo/)** ensures visibility across all search channels — classic and generative. To deepen your understanding of [content optimization strategies for generative AI](/en/blog/optimize-content-for-generative-ai/), it is essential to structure your approach around the trust criteria that determine source selection by language models.
